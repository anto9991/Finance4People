# Finance4People (now GoBull)
Personal project that aims to help non-financially educated people to invest.

I decided (for now) to analyze the S&P500 stocks and rank them on the basis of some financial indicators and techniques.
There are 2 major categorizations:
1. Greenblatt magic formula
2. Sharpe ratio

Each categorization then can be grouped by beta.

The purpose of categorization is to rank stocks by their value. 
The beta grouping aims to customize stock picks for the end customer, as low beta values indicate low volatility, making them ideal for low-risk investments.

The project has a BE side implemented in typescript using Fastify and a NoSQL DB (MongoDB); the FE is implemented in Flutter because it allowed me to develop for Android and IOS with just one codebase.

These images were meant for the iOS and Android app stores (they also provide an insight of the application0):
